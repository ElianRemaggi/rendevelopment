Rendevelopment Project
A modern, interactive Vue.js/Nuxt.js website showcasing real estate development services with scroll-driven animations and visual components.

Overview
Rendevelopment is a single-page application built to showcase real estate development services with an engaging, interactive user experience. The application features smooth scrolling, component-based content sections that animate based on scroll position, progressive content revelation, and responsive design.

Architecture
The application follows a component-based architecture centered around scroll position tracking and distribution to child components. The main page orchestrates the rendering and animation of various UI sections based on the user's scroll position.

Key Files and Their Roles
File	Role	Key Functionality
app.vue	Root application layout	Sets up VueLenis for smooth scrolling and background
pages/index.vue	Main page component	Orchestrates child components and tracks scroll position
components/ScrollPosition.vue	Debug component	Displays current scroll position
components/Tittle.vue	Hero section	Displays main title with scroll-based animations
components/Services.vue	Services section	Showcases available services with animations
components/Gallery.vue	Image gallery	Displays portfolio images with animations
components/Impacta.vue	Impact section	Highlights company impact with animations
components/Contact.vue	Contact form	Provides contact functionality
Scroll-Driven Animation System
The core feature of the application is its scroll-driven animation system that reveals and animates content as the user scrolls:

The main page component (pages/index.vue) captures scroll events through the Lenis library

It updates a shared scroll position value and provides it to all child components

Each component uses this value to determine when to trigger animations and visibility changes

Component Visibility Timeline
The application choreographs a sequence of component appearances based on scroll position, creating a seamless user experience as they navigate through the page.

Data Flow
The application follows a hierarchical component structure with data flowing from the main page to individual components:

Scroll events are captured by Lenis in app.vue

Scroll position is tracked in pages/index.vue

Scroll position value is shared with all child components

Each component independently reacts to the scroll position with custom animations

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (version 18 or higher)

npm or yarn

Installation

Building for Production

npm run build
Summary
The Rendevelopment codebase is a modern Vue.js/Nuxt.js application that creates an engaging user experience through scroll-based animations. The application uses a central scroll position state that is shared with all components, allowing each to react independently to the user's scroll position. This architecture, combined with the Lenis smooth scrolling library and animation libraries like GSAP, creates a visually compelling and interactive presentation of real estate development services.
